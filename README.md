# Brooklyn 99 Character Analysis 

As an aspiring data scientist and a fan of NBC's Brooklyn-99, I just had to look into data from the show. 

In my data analysis, I've undertaken the following steps:

1. downloaded 2 csv files from Kaggle 
2. combined and organized data for readability 
3. cleaned data
4. analyzed characters in the show and IMDB popularity & viewership to assess whether certain characters make a show more popular
