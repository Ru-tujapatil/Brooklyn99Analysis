# Brooklyn 99 Character Analysis 

As an aspiring data scientist and a fan of NBC's Brooklyn-99, I just had to look into data from the show. 

In my data analysis, I've undertaken the following steps:

1. download 2 csv files from Kaggle 
2. combine and organize data for readability 
3. clean data
4. analyze characters in the show and IMDB popularity & viewership to assess whetherc certain characters make a show more popular
